# Tables
From the database we will make 2 tables that can be used on our analysis.

## 1. **All About Film** (df_film)

In this table we will see a combination from 4 tables (category, film, language, inventory). This table will describe the Film's details, such as the inventory_id, category, title, release year, language, film length, rating, rental duration, and rental rate.

| Column | Table Origin | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | 
| inventory_id | inventory | Number of inventory |
| category | category | Film category |
| title | film | Film title |
| release_year | film | Film release year |
| language | language | Film language |
| length | film | Film duration (in minutes) |
| rating | film | Film rating (G, PG, PG-13, etc) |
| rental_duration | film | Length of rental period in days | 
| rental_rate | film | Cost to rent the film for the period specified in the rental_duration |



## 2. **Rental Duration and Geography** (df_durcon)

In this table we will see a combination from 6 tables (rental, category, film, payment, country, city). This table will show the actual rental duration and actual income per category. We will also look if there are any geographical relation with the category.

| Column | Table Origin | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| rental_id | rental | Unique key that identifies the rental |
| category | category | Film category |
| rating | film | Film rating (G, PG, PG-13, etc) |
| rental_rate | film | Cost to rent the film for the period specified in the rental_duration column |
| rental_duration | film | Length of the rental period in days |
| rental_length_day | film | Actual rental days (return_date - rental_date) |
| rental_date | rental | Actual rental day |
| payment | payment | The amount of payment (sum(amount)) |
| country | country | Where the rental takes place (country) |
| city | city | Where the rental takes place (city) |


# Data Manipulation
After we constructing the tables, we have to treat the missing values, change data type, and make new feature.

**df_film**
While there are no missing values on all the columns, we have wrong data type assigned to the rental_rate column. The rental_rate column is the rate of borrowing film in dollar. The data type should be float not object.

**df_durcon**
We have missing values on the rental_length_day and the wrong data type also assigned to the rental_rate and payment column. 

# Data Visualization & Statistics
In this section we will try to answer these questions:
1.	Where is our current inventory position?
2.	Total sales contribution according to category
3.	Can current inventory fulfil the customerâ€™s need?
4.	Are there any difference on the average of the payment by category?
5.	What is the proportion of the payment that are overdue?
6.	Payment trend?
7.	Rental location increasing/decreasing?
